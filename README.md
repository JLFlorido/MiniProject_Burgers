# First_MiniProject
First project of phd. Wanted to look at implementation of Raissi's NN for solving burger's equation, investigating hyperparameters involved.
The code looked at was obtained from okada39's github page, and modified to investigate results.

A FDM code was written to compare the NN performance against. To establish whther this solution was accurate enough to use as comparison a short study was done looking at the L2 error as the grid was further refined.
